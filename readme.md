# Minesweeper for Taste
## Developed for Tastebud

This version of Minesweeper is based off of [JavaApps-Minesweeper by AlqasimO](https://github.com/AlqasimO/JavaApps-Minesweeper) and is adapted for Tastebud - a device that gives the player gustatory (taste) feedback through a disposable mouthpiece whilst playing the game.

This adaption was developed alongside Tastebud as part of my Final Year Project for the degree MComp Computer Science at the University of Sussex 2017.
